# HytaleServer AI Documentation

This directory contains AI-generated documentation for the [HytaleServer](https://github.com/Savag3life/TaleServer) project — a community-driven effort to understand and document the Hytale dedicated server.

## What is this?

These docs were created by analyzing the decompiled server source code. They aim to provide:

- **API overviews** for core systems (events, worlds, instances)
- **Thread safety guidance** and concurrency patterns
- **Performance considerations** and best practices
- **Code examples** for common operations
